## Cursor for a Help icon

A sample Help icon: <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/344/help.png" alt="help icon" />

The `Help` icon basically is supposed to help people see a helpful message by a user's action.
There are 2 following user actions, and I'm going to describe how the cursor should be on each action.
(Ref for names of the cursor style: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/cursor#:~:text=of%20the%20image.-,keyword,-A%20keyword%20value)

- Mouse Over (Mouse Hover)

The cursor: `default` or `help`

There are no user action, except `Mouse Hover`.
The `help` cursor might be better because users can notice that there is something when the cursor changes.

- Mouse Click

The cursor: `pointer`

Users think its icon is clickable when the cursor is changed to the `pointer` icon.
